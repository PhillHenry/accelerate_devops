It's a story as old as software itself.

Managers think: "why don't these engineers understand we have deadlines in the real world?"

The engineers likewise wonder: "we've explained the problem so many times, is this guy just stupid?"

Now here's the kicker: nobody has the monopoly on common sense. Rather, it's just another example of the [**double empathy problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_empathy_problem).

The idea behind it is simple. If people don't generally understand neurodivergent individuals then other neurodivergents shouldn't either. Twice the divergence, right?  Except that *neurodivergent people tend to understand each other very well*.  

Now, it's worth mentioning at this point that I've not said which side (engineers or managers) are neurodivergent. 
You probably assumed I was inferring it was the engineers. 
I don't blame you. I would.


But the double empathy problem is about *mutual* misunderstanding. 
Neurodivergence can operate at all levels of an organisation.

Interestingly, the double empathy problem challenged decades of accepted wisdom that framed empathy difficulties as common amongst autistic people.
(Fun fact: a lot of this accepted wisdom was established by Simon Baron Cohen, cousin of comedian, Sacha).

So, next time you find yourself arguing with somebody on the other side, take a deep breath, pause and think about things from their point of view.
