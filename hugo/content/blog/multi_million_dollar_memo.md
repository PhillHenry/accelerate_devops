The billionaire CEO, Jeff Bezos, sent a [memo](https://github.com/victorvalentee/bezos_api_mandate) in 2002 to all of Amazon telling them how they were going to architect AWS. 
His vision was Abstract Programming Interfaces - or  APIs as engineers call them.
Anybody who did not obey would be cheerfully fired.
This brilliant idea would lead Amazon to dominate the cloud space. 

As the joke goes, the CEO should spend 80% of time pleasing shareholder and the other 30% checking the numbers are correct.
So, how could Bezos have such technical insight? 

The reason is that American tech CEOs understand technology. 
It's not something icky that they detest dirtying their hands with.
Bezos, after all, has a degree in electrical engineering.

The British, however, still regard tech as something beneath them. 
The rot started in the late 19th Century with what is commonly called the "decline of the industrial spirit".
During this time, the heirs to the early industrialists regarded attending factory matters as something unbecoming of a gentleman.
Consequently, the Germans and Americans overtook Britain in GDP per capita some time in the 1890s.

Some might say this disdain continues in the British managerial class.
A South African colleague once pointed out to me that British managers love to tackle problems by throwing large numbers of workers at it - a hang-over from the days of the Industrial Revolution when more factory workers meant more spoons were manufactured.

In the world of knowledge workers, the correct approach is the very opposite. The Googles of this world have small, focused teams of highly competent (and highly paid) engineers.

I probably lost half the British audience by mentioning APIs in my first paragraph.
