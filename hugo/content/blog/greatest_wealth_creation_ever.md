We're living in a time of the greatest creation of wealth the world has ever seen. And who is responsible for this? The politicians? The bankers? The MBAs? 

No, it's the nerds.

Let's take a look at what these founders studied at University:

Jeff Bezos: Electrical Engineering and Computing
<br/>
Sergey Brin (Google): Computer Science and Mathematics
<br/>
Larry Ellison (Oracle): Physica and Mathematics
<br/>
Bill Gates: Mathematics and Computer Science
<br/>
Elon Musk: Physics
<br/>
Larry Page (Google): Computer Engineering
<br/>
Steve Wozniak (Apple): Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
<br/>
Mark Zuckerberg: Psychology and Computer Science

Now, you might not like them all, you might not like some of their politics but you cannot deny that there is a strong correlation between being a self-made billionaire and being a geek.

So, why do we in the West view geeks with such contempt?
