## Isn't that what all consultancies say? {itemprop=name}
{{% faq-answer %}}
Yes, but while the others try to place fresh graduates and bill them as experts, we guarantee that nobody you deal with has less than 20 years of hands-on experience. 
Such people are hard to come by so you know we're not going to fill your ranks with an army of expensive juniors.

Also, we don't have affiliations with other organisations. 
We're not going to surreptitiously sell you services and products where we get a commission. 
Unfortunately, this is common practise in the industry.

## OK, but how exactly will you save my project? {itemprop=name}
{{% faq-answer %}}
We will:
1. conduct a 2-week audit.
2. select a team or two for whom we apply our techniques
3. observe their progress using standard industry metrics
4. if you like what you see (you will) then roll it out to the rest of the business.

## I already have consultants on my project. Why do I need more? {itemprop=name}
{{% faq-answer %}}
It is essential to have external experts auditing the process. 
Asking your current consultants to do this is asking them to mark their own homework.
