      <p>Around 2002, the billionaire CEO, Jeff Bezos, sent a <a href="https://github.com/victorvalentee/bezos_api_mandate">memo</a> to all of Amazon telling them how they were going to architect AWS.
His vision was Abstract Programming Interfaces - or  APIs as engineers call them.
Anybody who did not obey would be cheerfully fired.
This brilliant idea would lead Amazon to dominate the cloud space.</p>
<p>As the joke goes, the CEO should spend 80% of time pleasing shareholder and the other 30% checking the numbers are correct.
So, how could Bezos have such technical insight?</p>
<p>The reason is that American tech CEOs understand technology.
It&rsquo;s not something icky that they detest dirtying their hands with.
Bezos, after all, has a degree in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>The British, however, still regard tech as something beneath them.
The rot started in the late 19th Century with what is commonly called the &ldquo;decline of the industrial spirit&rdquo;.
During this time, the heirs to the early industrialists regarded attending factory matters as something unbecoming of a gentleman.
Consequently, the Germans and Americans overtook Britain in GDP per capita some time in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Some might say this disdain continues in the British managerial class.
A South African colleague once pointed out to me that British managers love to tackle problems by throwing large numbers of workers at it - a hang-over from the days of the Industrial Revolution when more factory workers meant more spoons were manufactured.</p>
<p>In the world of knowledge workers, the correct approach is the very opposite. The Googles of this world have small, focussed teams of highly competent (and highly paid) engineers.</p>
