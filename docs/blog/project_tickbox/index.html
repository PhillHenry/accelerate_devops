      <p>This is not an exhaustive list but as a bare minimum you need the following:</p>
<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hire good developers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a really important one so why is it relatively rare?
Well, partly because hiring managers generally don&rsquo;t know what a good developer looks like and partly because good developers are expensive.
Our advice is to hire <strong>fewer but better</strong> developers.
You&rsquo;ll also reduce communication overhead which is a huge productivity killer.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Eat your own dog food</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If the people building the product are not the people maintaining it, guess what?
They&rsquo;ll build a product where maintenance is not the most important property and instead prioritise getting a product out of the door.
That&rsquo;s just human nature.
This was rampant in the outsourcing craze of the early 2000s.
These days, staff are generally <strong>embedded</strong> in the development team if work is outsourced to a third party.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Quality requirements</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Work tickets need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be first approved by the people implementing them</li>
<li>to be as accurate as possible</li>
<li>to have acceptance criteria that define what &lsquo;done&rsquo; means.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s often horse trading between the implementers and the business when agreeing on what exactly a ticket includes.
So, in this most human of tech processes, emotional safety is key.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Emotional safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Steve Jobs once <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8586131-it-doesn-t-make-sense-to-hire-smart-people-and-then">said</a>:  &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jobs was famously abusive but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he was wrong here.
Upper management need to listen to the troops.
It takes more than one-off away days to facilitate this.
Instead there must be regular stakeholder involvement, preferably daily.
A lot of <strong>Agile practices</strong> advocate this so if you&rsquo;re not employing at least some of these principals, you should.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Say &rsquo;no&rsquo; to silos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&lsquo;Scrum manager&rsquo; is a role not a job.</p>
<p>&lsquo;DevOps&rsquo; is a discipline not a team.</p>
<p>The more you silo people, the more corner cases will slip through the cracks.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Regular back-and-forth</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Show-and-tells, burn down charts, retrospectives - these are all ways to ensure people are aligned. There should never be any surprises in the timelines if <strong>communication</strong> is done properly.</p>
<p>This applies to all levels in the organisation, not just devs. For instance, HSBC has even project managers reporting the C-level execs every two weeks giving their RAG score (red, amber or green). Projects are allowed to make only one move per iteration. The ire of the board will be invoked if a project <em>suddenly</em> goes from green to red.</p>
<p>The unfortunate corollary to this, of course, is that most projects stay at amber. But at least there is no smoke being blown up the management chain when people try to disguise a struggling project.</p>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automated regression tests</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to find an open source project without <strong>continuous integration</strong> but I still see some in industry.
Regression tests are the single best way to ensure a code base is resilient.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Logging</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Good logging is the key to effective maintenance.
It&rsquo;s also the first thing to be neglected if the devs are not the maintainers (see &ldquo;Eat your own dog food&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In the last decade or so, everything has become distributed so logs that live in multiple places need to be aggregated.
There are some tools to do this (I&rsquo;ve heard good things about DataDog although I&rsquo;ve never used it).
But the main thing is that you need people who&rsquo;s expertise spans different systems.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Nobody goes back to tech documentation and updates it in a busy organisation.
You just have to accept that devs don&rsquo;t have the time and professional documenters rarely have the low level insight.
However, documentation can be generated by the test suite (see above).
That way, both code and docs are in lock-step.</p>
